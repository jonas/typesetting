# Type Setting

Scala library for mapping TypeSafe config to settings expressed in terms of
their type and configuration path.

> Typesetting is the composition of text by means of arranging physical types or
> the digital equivalents. Stored letters and other symbols (called sorts in
> mechanical systems and glyphs in digital systems) are retrieved and ordered
> according to a language's orthography for visual display.
-- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting)

Inspired by Jon Pretty's talk [Reducing The Slippery Surface of Failure with
Dependent Types](http://rapture.io/talks/slippery-surface/) and based on code
from [Rapture's](https://github.com/propensive/rapture) CLI module.
